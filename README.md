# Object Oriented exercise in Ruby

This small program was an assignment for Lighthouse Labs. The objective was to create a two-player math game using classes. 
The UI for this game is the terminal/console.

In order to try this game out, you need to have Ruby installed. 

Clone this repository, open your terminal, and cd into the folder that contains the repository. 

Then you can run 

    $ruby main.rb
  
This will prompt you for the name of the two players and the desired game difficulty. After this, the two players will 
take turns answering math questions until one player runs out of lives. Have fun!
